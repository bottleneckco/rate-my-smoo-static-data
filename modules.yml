    name: 'Managing in a VUCA Context'
    description: |
      The dynamic and fast changing nature of our world today is best described by VUCA, a term coined by the US Army War College. VUCA stands for Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous. The Arab Spring saw a change of government in countries like Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen. Once powerful countries in Europe are now fighting bankruptcy. The growth of the developing world which was taken for granted has begun to slow down. Even companies that were synonymous with their product categories just a few years ago are now no longer in existence. Kodak, the inventor of the digital camera had to wind up its operations, Borders, once the second largest US bookstore, has shut down due to their inability to evolve their business models with the changing times.  With such momentous changes happening in the world today, this course prepares the students to better understand the complexity and difficulties in reacting to the ambiguity inherent in those changes. This course helps students to understand the tensions in a given situation and how they need to think through a problem from multiple dimensions. The course aims to give students an insight into the mega trends and forces that are impacting their world. Ask what are some of the causes of these trends and their business implications? What can future managers like themselves do about understanding these changing trends, and why they need to address, appreciate, adapt and attempt to manage these changes in their ecosystem? The course aims to introduce some basic VUCA concepts, in order to broaden their world view of management and nature of managing complex problems. The first half of the course introduces some of these trends, while the second half provides tools and possible frameworks to deal with the VUCA aspects that they will face in the future.

    name: 'Interaction Design and Prototyping'
    description: |
      Information systems are by necessity highly structured and predictable. Human life, on the other hand, is messy and unpredictable. When we try to fit human life into the structures expected by information systems, problems are inevitable. Interaction Design is a collection of tools for tackling these problems. When applied well, these tools can help you to build information systems that are useful, usable, and a pleasure to use.Interaction design is an iterative process. Each iteration has three stages: 

      - **Observation:** We watch what users do to determine their needs. Watching is essential, because users often do not know or cannot express what they need. 

      - **Prototyping:** We collect our design ideas into representations that users can interact with. Prototypes vary from very rough (low-fidelity) to more polished (high-fidelity). 

      - **Evaluation:** We learn how well our design is meeting users’ needs. There are many evaluation strategies that vary by accuracy and cost of execution. Because this is an iterative process, we do not seek perfect solutions.

      Instead, we focus early iterations on the most important problems, building inexpensive prototypes, and conducting fast evaluations. In later iterations, we use methods that take more effort to apply, but give more robust results.

      This course will teach you how to lead a professional interaction design project. You and your project group will learn the interaction design process as you design an application of your own choosing.

At securities exchanges, open-cry trading floors have been replaced by automated trade matching and straight-thru-processing (STP) has replaced error-prone paper-based settlements processing resulting in shorter settlement cycles.

      This course provides an introduction to the financial markets products and services, markets and market participants.  Focus will be placed on the foreign exchange and equities products and the processes that support the trading and settlement of these instruments.  The course will include the architecture and design of the IT application systems that support these processes. It will cover how the deployment of STP has enabled efficiencies and eliminated risks by the end-to-end streamlining of operations within and across firms from trade initiation to settlement.

      Upon completion of the course, students will have gained knowledge on:

      The following aspects of the FX & EQ markets:

      Markets & market participants
