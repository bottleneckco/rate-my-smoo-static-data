    name: 'Web Application Development I'
    description: |
      Web applications are commonly used today by governments, enterprises, and even individuals to provide information, market products, etc. Ability to create web applications is thus a crucial skill for graduates in Information Systems. This course is designed to equip students with the knowledge and skill to develop well-styled database-driven web applications. In the early weeks of the course, students would be introduced to web concepts and trained to build static web pages using HTML. Next, students will be taught on how to program dynamic web applications using PHP. Programming concepts that students have learned in Introduction to Programming (IS111) will be revisited (using PHP as the programming language), expanded, and used to allow students to program web applications that can adapt based on user inputs. After basic PHP programming has been introduced, students will then be taught on how they can connect to a database to store, retrieve, modify, and delete data. They can then design dynamic web pages that present different contents reflecting contents stored in a database as well as allow users to modify database contents through the webpages. In the latter weeks of the course, students will be introduced to more advanced PHP concepts including session management to allow for stateful interactive information exchange between users and a web application. Students will also be introduced on two ways of validating user inputs: server validation (using PHP) and client validation (using Javascript). Additionally, students will be introduced to methods to style their web pages using CSS and Bootstrap.

    name: 'Business Process Analysis and Solutioning'
    description: |
      In any organization, a business process is a key asset which is a collection of related, structured activities or tasks that produce a specific service or product (serve a particular goal) for a particular customer or customers. The business objective of an organization is often to increase process speed or reduce cycle time; to increase quality; or to reduce costs, such as labour, materials, scrap, or capital costs. In other words, a management decision to invest in business process modeling is often motivated by the need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the processes that exist within and across organizations. Business Process Analysis and Solutioning course presents the concepts and methodologies required to execute a methodical approach to translate business process change requirements into clear IT solutions. The course will cover business process modelling and analysis. The goal is to identify the gaps in the business workflow and recommend the solutions based on technology solutioning or restructuring the workflows for process optimization. The course will ensure that the students can smoothly translate enterprise business objectives into an effective IT solution architecture. Business process innovation has become a growing interest of several sectors due to the exponential growth of new technologies such as social media, big data, analytics, machine learning, IoTs and artificial intelligence. The students will be exposed to the various technologies and there role in process innovation. They will be able to analyse and review the innovated the business processes by studying some industry cases of digital transformation.

  IS211:
    name: 'Interaction Design and Prototyping'
    description: |
      Information systems are by necessity highly structured and predictable. Human life, on the other hand, is messy and unpredictable. When we try to fit human life into the structures expected by information systems, problems are inevitable. Interaction Design is a collection of tools for tackling these problems. When applied well, these tools can help you to build information systems that are useful, usable, and a pleasure to use.Interaction design is an iterative process. Each iteration has three stages: 

      - **Observation:** We watch what users do to determine their needs. Watching is essential, because users often do not know or cannot express what they need. 

      - **Prototyping:** We collect our design ideas into representations that users can interact with. Prototypes vary from very rough (low-fidelity) to more polished (high-fidelity). 

      - **Evaluation:** We learn how well our design is meeting users’ needs. There are many evaluation strategies that vary by accuracy and cost of execution. Because this is an iterative process, we do not seek perfect solutions.

      Instead, we focus early iterations on the most important problems, building inexpensive prototypes, and conducting fast evaluations. In later iterations, we use methods that take more effort to apply, but give more robust results.

      This course will teach you how to lead a professional interaction design project. You and your project group will learn the interaction design process as you design an application of your own choosing.

    name: 'Enterprise Solution Development'
    description: |
      With the emergence of new technologies and evolution of existing ones, organizations are changing the way they build enterprise solutions. Rather than build monolithic applications, the current emphasis is on building solutions by leveraging existing functionality exposed as services. This approach to composing solutions using services follows the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) paradigm, where applications are structured as a collection of loosely coupled services. In this course students will learn how to design and implement enterprise solutions using SOA using enterprise tools. The course will cover topics such as cloud computing, SOA, Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), XML, web services and micro-services architecture.
